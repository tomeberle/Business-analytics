5,2021-05-04,11:41:54,Nokia is extremely undervalued at current pricesDiscussion (self.wallstreetbets),Shark0710,443,124,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4m8mw/nokia_is_extremely_undervalued_at_current_prices/,"On April 29, Nokia reported stellar first quarter earnings for 2021: Revenue totaled €5.1 billion, 7% above the consensus estimates. Gross margin was 38.2%, improving from 36.4% in this quarter last year. EBITDA was €702 million, crushing the estimates of €150 million by over 367%. It generated €1.2 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, turning positive from the negative €6 million during Q1 2020. Nokia’s focus on 5G is already paying off. Management is seeing “continued momentum in 5G rollouts across all geographies, especially North America.” And from the favorable margins in Nokia’s 5G products, gross margin in mobile networks improved 2.1% from last year, reaching 33.2% during the quarter. And Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark – which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations – made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations. The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips. This lowers the total cost of ownership for wireless providers – a great selling point. Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. And this month technology consulting firm PA Consulting named Nokia “the industry leader in 5G standard essential patents.” Nokia has a leading patent portfolio with over 3,500 patents that are declared as essential to 5G. Nokia’s patent portfolio will help it maintain a technological advantage compared to its competitors. Nokia remains extremely undervalued at current prices and it remains a strong buy. It was the first breakthrough quarter for Nokia and it is going to be a big winner for us."

7,2021-05-04,12:39:19,Time to buy the dip $AMD - short DDDD (self.wallstreetbets),blackrose192,243,118,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4ncpw/time_to_buy_the_dip_amd_short_dd/,"Hello fellow autists. ​ Wanted to share some quick DD and some of my reasons why it's a good time to jump on the AMD train as a mid-long term investment. Full disclosure i have 100 shares and 2 short puts on AMD expiring 5/7 @$85. here we go. ​ Why buy? $AMD released their earnings last week with some pretty stellar results both on YoY and vs consensus estimate. They increased their full year guidance from a 37% YoY growth to 50%, and what does the market do? It dumps the crap out of the stock down almost $12 from earnings intraday high of $89. They say stonk prices are valued by future potential and not past performance, and it seems the market doesn't like good earnings or upgrades to forecasts. This I don't understand and this market movement downwards presents an opportunity to buy in when the stock is undervalued. As a gamer, i recognise how AMD has transformed over the years, and simply as a chip maker its clearly the market leader in CPU's now, and with an all encompassing monopoly over the current of consoles. There's simply no downside to their current trajectory. ​ Chip shortage. The elephant in the room is obviously the global chip shortage. I believe this is the core reason for all the FUD. If we dig a bit deeper the chip shortage is really because of Covid, more people at home to work, play and learn means more demand for tech, which is a great thing in the mid to long run. But I believe that the market is being short sighted at the moment, focussing in, and penalising AMD because of their percieved risk around being able to pump out enough stock to meet demand. ​ Final thought End of the day, i think if your investment horizon is more than 12months, there is a pretty strong bull case for AMD. Looking at the 1 year chart, there is a pretty strong support around $73-75. As always do your own research , but hopefully you'll see what a massive potential AMD is. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 ​ https://preview.redd.it/cznh9hm6j3x61.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=f982f936b4337cca2f1b63452b526fc0045cda1b"
8,2021-05-04,15:27:51,AMD: An explanation on merger arbitrage and how to play it for big gainsDD (self.wallstreetbets),darkfiber-,99,52,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/,"I read long and boring white papers from really smart people so you apes don't have to. Here's the gist. Background: AMD expected 37% growth this year but in Q1 revised it to 50% growth. Meanwhile, Intel expects -1% growth. Analysts continually upgrade AMD to Buy increasing price targets. The current medium target is $106 with a high of $135, the stock is at $77. Why is it so low and not moving? Merger Arbitrage: In October of last year AMD announced it was acquiring XLNX in an all-stock fixed ratio deal. That is, 1.72 shares of AMD for every 1 share of XLNX. This action immediately kicks off hedge fund arbitrageurs to do their thing. For the smooth brainers, Arbitrage is the trading of the same asset on different mediums to profit from the difference (I had to look it up too). After merger announcement, XLNX jumped to a share ratio of ~1.55, about 10% off of the 1.72 final merger price. The 10% difference is there because of the possibility the deal will not actually close. Arbitrageurs aim to profit from this difference. ​ https://public.tableau.com/profile/upndown#!/vizhome/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the 10% price difference. So long as the deal goes through, the profits are locked in and guaranteed with this strategy, no matter how the market moves. ​ https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2230048 What sucks about this is that all the short selling always causes the acquirer stock to go down. That's what's happening to AMD. AMD's daily volume is ~50M with 20% of it being short selling. Hedge funds know people like AMD so they can play another game on top of the arbitrage which is to shoot for Max Pain. Not to be confused with the awesome video game series. Max Pain is when they can get the price of a stock to the point where the most option holders lose the most money. Meaning no matter if you bought calls or puts, you lose, they win. So how does one win? I wouldn't recommend doing what they do because there's the potential for unlimited loss if the merger falls through. But once the merger is complete, the short selling stops and the stock normalizes. In the case of AMD, normal is 25% above the current price, that's going to be a huge jump. ​ https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2230048 I think the safe play would be to buy XLNX stock, so one gets the ~10% discount, and buy LEAPS on AMD (long calls expiring after the merger). For example, if one buys AMD calls at a $80 strike expiring in June 2022 for $12, if the stock were to merely normalize to $106 at the end of the year after the merger, the options would be worth $26, an easy 110% profit. The other, more riskier option, is to buy AMD options expiring throughout the year, hoping the negative pressure of the short selling arbitrage stops before the merger. This can happen if XLNX shares get too close to the 1.72 ratio, then arbitrage doesn't work and the short selling stops which will push AMD higher. Or if AMD shares jump huge suddenly, which can happen on some amazing news, or if AMD decides to offer dividend payments, or especially if the deal falls through, which will force hedge funds to cover early, thus pushing the stock even higher all at once, to the moon. Either way, this negative pressure from arbitrage short selling has an end date. The fundamentals are so good, one could bet on it. Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I don't really know what I'm doing. But I like the stock. Positions: I'm doing both strategies and own AMD shares and call options spread across this year and next year. I also own XLNX shares."
9,2021-05-04,00:54:35,MindMed ($MNMD) and the upcoming Psychedelics #ShroomBoom 🍄Discussion (self.wallstreetbets),moneymonster420,1403,466,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4c6yo/mindmed_mnmd_and_the_upcoming_psychedelics/,"TL;DR = MindMed will solve and own the hundred-billion dollar market to treat depression, alcoholism, opioid addiction, anxiety, PTSD and much more. MindMed will be releasing their Phase 2 results using LSD to treat anxiety very soon which was completed May 1, 2021! https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03153579 Sold off from NASDAQ uplisting, but now institutions are going to load the boat ($MNMD sits at 0.09% institutional ownership of the stock vs. $CMPS at 16%). Also there could be ""forced buying"" by biotech ETFs such as $XBI and $IBB once $MNMD gets included/indexed. Also short interest is pretty high, so a big bounce is coming if the stock starts moving back to the upside. EDIT: Does anyone know when options start trading? (Usually 1 week or so from an IPO/Uplisting?) Huge TAM (Total Addressable Market) Background on the Sector There are three topics everyone who wants to understand the Psychedelic Sector needs to know up front: 1) Intent: This sector is fundamentally different from the Cannabis Sector in a large way. The target market is primarily medicinal uses rather than recreational uses. Cannabis has a large recreational movement, where psychedelics have a small one. While this may deter some folks, I find it reassuring: to play in this space a company must be serious and committed. 2) Diversity: There are a number of drugs in the psychedelic space - psilocybin (mushrooms), LSD (acid), MDMA (ecstasy), ketamine (anesthetic), to name a few. Each is in some stage of clinical trials, and each company is attempting to use different ones to treat different mental and behavioral health conditions. These conditions are diverse as well, though the largest target markets include ADHD, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and drug and alcohol addiction. 3) Delivery: Psychedelic research today is not seeking to put high volumes of over-the-counter mushrooms or LSD pills in your local CVS. Psychedelics are being researched in controlled microdoses, and the intended delivery is by trained therapists through guided psychotherapy sessions. Psychedelics on their own may give your mind a period of disconnection and subdued feelings of fear, but with proper guidance from a trained therapist this period also becomes an opportunity for ""rewiring"" old mental blocks that lead to mental illness. Some people begin to break through chronic mental health barriers in just a few appointments. CNN recently covered the sector in an hour long special under Lisa Ling's ""This is Life"" series called ""Psychedelic Healing"" (Season 7, Episode 6). This demonstrates the delivery method well, as well as several early success stories. MindMed DD --> Kevin O'Leary, Bruce Linton and the Najarian Brothers are in this Left: Bruce Linton (Founder & Ex-CEO of $CGC) Right: Kevin O'Leary (Shark Tank) are big investors/backers of MindMed Though my summary is below, don’t just take my word for it! MindMed has an incredibly well organized website where you can see much of this for yourself. As an investor in a sector with a diversity of molecules and a diversity of applications, you want a company that has a diverse approach. That’s MindMed - which is in Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials with each 18-MC, LSD, MDMA, DMT, and psilocybin tackling a variety of conditions, including anxiety, opioid withdrawal, ADHD, and cluster headaches, to name a few. This diversity give MindMed a high chance of having not just one, but several breakthrough molecules. Kevin O’Leary (yes, Shark Tank’s Mr. Wonderful) is perhaps the most well-known investor in MindMed. As an investor in a sector that requires integration with therapists, including new tools and training, you want a company that is developing more than just the necessary drugs. MindMed is the whole package. MindMed has paired with NYU to develop therapist training strategies and has announced its launch of Albert, a digital medicine division meant to tie it all together. MindMed's recent announcements have indicated they are actively hiring to give this division more depth and to potentially undertake an acquisition in the digital platform space. MindMed is already thinking about how we make this work. In the future, a therapist will have use this digital tool to keep a list of psychedelic options catered to a host of mental conditions, and each will be tied to delivery strategies and training. MindMed's wholistic view from clinical trials through implementation is what sets them apart from others in the sector. As an investor in a sector that is ""breakthrough"" in nature, you want a company that has the right leadership. In January, Robert Barrow entered the MindMed team as the Chief Development Officer. Robert brings extensive knowledge of psilocybin research, but more importantly he was part of securing the Breakthrough Therapy Designation with the FDA for his prior psilocybin program (Phase 2 Clinical Trials) at the Usona Institute. MindMed hopes to secure similar breakthrough designations for their trials and fast-track them. Bruce Linton, former Canopy Growth (CGC) Chairman and CEO, sits on MindMed's Board of Directors. Dr. Halperin Wernli and Carol Nast, President and COO respectively, each help round out the management team with over 50 combined years of leadership in drug and product development in emerging markets and heavily regulated environments. Finally, I know every investor wants to know how much the stock price will move over time, so here are a few catalysts to think on: FDA \""Breakthrough\"" designation coming? Next catalysts: This is more obvious, but of course any trial milestones are catalysts! I’m particularly excited about August/September this year when we expect Phase 2b trial results to begin rolling in, though Phase 1 announcements will continue to occur as the portfolio grows as well. With any luck, breakthrough designations will accelerate trials and portfolio growth further."
