Closing volume has ramped up steadily over the same period from 6.3m to 42.4m Two major catalysts are on the near horizon: 1) Earnings report on 5/24 AH: Confirmation of late Q3 production and disclosure of binding orders have a high probability of being announced. 2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.

Please let me know if another flair is more appropriate. I'm not going to get into the financials, since plenty of solid DD has been done on that already. However, I did mention in my last post (analyzing the market sectors) that I would look into positions related to the real estate sector (XLRE). My thought process here it to take a look at the short term momentum for this stock due to the recent positive earnings, great financials, positive future outlook, and upcoming June Ex-Div date. Lets jump into it and make it quick... Since there is a lot of talk regarding Russell inclusion, here is the RRG of UWMC again UWM: Looks like we have strong short term momentum when compared to the Russell 2000 Now for SPY: Starting to take off with solid momentum towards leading. Finally, XLRE: No surprise. Similar to SPY My Thoughts: Personally, the company has strong fundamentals. So, in combination with the momentum, I think its a decent ""buy"" (this is not professional financial advice). I'm playing this 3 ways: 6/18 short put x 2 @ $7 7/16 long call x 5 @ $6 1100 shares @ $8.06 Edit 1: Silly me, I forgot to mention that a share buyback plan was approved which also contributes to the positive momentum. TL;DR: UWMC looks good. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

Sector rotation, tech bubble fear, jump in 10-year treasury rate marked the beginning of inflation fear. And mistrust in FED that JPOW will not raise interest rate until at least 2023. Big tech's earnings absolutely destroyed estimates but sell side thinks it's due to lock down and people will rely on tech less once things open up. It's a consistent pattern that all the gains made after earning erode overnight or in a few trading session as if the good earning did not happen. At the same time, the indexes are still hover around all time high. Remember how excited this sub was when SPY edging $400 and we are now still at $410. Meanwhile small growth stocks have 5% - 10% up and down days regularly and overall down 30% - 50% from ATH. The pre-market can be deeply red and the day can end slightly green or close to it like today. Market can reverse anytime in any direction like playing Uno reverse card. The world is still hella messy. Fear of second covid wave in Europe, Asia, and even America. Big government wants to spend trillions of dollars. More spending and more stimulus so the market should go up right? Wait a second, how about inflation? Same information, mixed understanding, and complete opposite decision on the market. So far, the sell side seems winning but the market seems to be really confused on where it should go."
9,2021-05-20,05:24:49,$TWLO stands to be the primary source for commercial text messagingDD (self.wallstreetbets),awestons,20,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngrqqf/twlo_stands_to_be_the_primary_source_for/,"Some context: Cell carriers in the US have decided to stop the function of shared short codes (5-6 digit phone numbers) June 1. Shared short codes were the preferred means of SMS and MMS communication for B2C traffic. Short codes were free to lease in many cases, text messages were cheap, thousands of businesses could send from the same number, and throughput was incredibly high (lots of messages could be sent very fast). The new policy enforced by the CTIA (The private club all major cell phone carriers are in) is that shared short codes are to be discontinued and replaced by dedicated short codes and A2P 10dlc (approved B2C traffic on 10-digit phone numbers). This means that every business/organization that wants to send texts must either apply for a dedicated short code or apply for a 10DLC. Dedicated short codes are the preferred choice for large corporations. They can handle large throughput and look good for the brand. However, they only cater to large corporations because they are thousands of dollars/year to lease. Turn around time for application is 4-6 weeks. Barrier to entry is high. 10DLC is the preferred choice for the smaller businesses since it's less expensive. But, it is still far more expensive than the shared short codes businesses are used to, requires application, and costs $50/mo in carrier and registration fees alone. Turn around time for application is less than a week. On top of fees, 10dlc isn't even fully ready. The Campaign Registry, the organization responsible for rolling out ""the new messaging standard"" for the CTIA, is still developing their API. Enter Toll-free messaging. TF has 0 barrier to entry and can be issued to a business with SMS and MMS capabilities in seconds. It's the easiest and now the most cost-effective way to send commercial messages. Conveniently, every major carrier announced this month (for the first time) that they will start collecting a $0.0025/message fee for every sms sent. They're ready for and expecting businesses to move to this method. Who is Zipwhip: Zipwhip was given full reign over all TF traffic. Anyone in the US that wants to send messages on TF codes uses Zipwhip in one way or another. They are a massive reseller that everyone is required to go through. It was recently announced the Twilio plans on acquiring Zipwhip for $850M. Twilio is the leader is programmable messaging hands down. Honestly, there should be antitrust issues that arise and block the acquisition. If it goes through, Twilio owns the new world of business sms. Good chance regulators won't notice any issue. They'll miss the fact that businesses will be pressured into TF over their preferred solutions (dedicated short codes and A2P 10DLC) since it's unnecessarily complicated and expensive. TF is ready now and cheap. TL;DR if Twilio successfully acquires Zipwhip, every small to medium sized business that wants to send texts will have to go through them. Every single one of them in the US."

We’ve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17. Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22....... Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28. If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates. Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesn’t materialize that could be a >10x return based on how cheap the <$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options. If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide. If the squeeze materializes then you make all your money there and lose alittle on some cheap put options that could be the real money makers."

12,2021-05-20,08:25:07,How Big is SRNE news release about Sofusa success?OCDD (self.wallstreetbets),biutifo,9,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ngulnq/how_big_is_srne_news_release_about_sofusa_success/,"So just how big is today's news about the initial success of the Sofusa technology? 1st, this is a technology that aims at lymphatic delivery. What does this mean? Well, when trying to fight a disease, it's difficult to target the lymphatic system. Because of how it works and the fact that it is spread throughout our body. So there are MANY, MANY drugs out there that treat several conditions through the lymphatic system. But, because of what we just explained, those drugs sometimes don't work. They are not properly ""delivered"". They don't get to where they need to get to make the necessary interaction and solve the problem. Sorrento has developed a technology that can deliver drugs to where they actually need to go in the lymphatic system. So this is definitely breakthrough technology. Other companies are aiming to find similar solutions. But we are definitely talking about very advanced bio-tech. In this case, we have a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. This is a condition that worsens with time. It's very painful and limits the patient's movement. It's not very common, so we are talking about 1.5 million people in the USA and about 30 million worldwide. But remember, the technology Sorrento is developing will be able to deliver drugs treating many other diseases related to the lymphatic system. So the market for Sofusa is very, very large. The press release tells us Sofusa was tested on ""First Enbrel-Non-Responding"" patients. What does this mean? Patients who need the drug Enbrel and, even though they have not been taking the drug for long (it's a ""first"" for them) they are not responding to it. It isn't helping them. Now, Sofusa comes into play. It's job is to deliver Enbrel to the patient effectively. To ""take"" Enbrel to where it needs to go in the lymphatic system.. The 1st obvious advantage is that the drug wasn't helping and now helps. But there are other important advantages. Since the drug is being carried to its targeted ""destination"" the dosage needed, diminishes. Because less is ""lost along the way"". This is important because many diseases related to the lymphatic system, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are chronic, lifelong conditions. Being able to administer less drugs really helps the patient. Now you have a drug that actually works, more potently, which reduces its dosage. All this thanks to Sorrento. The press release points out an important factor: This is a trial on ONE type of drug/treatment. Other such trials testing the effectiveness of Sofusa are already taking place. Again, this is proof of the potentially huge market for this delivery system. Just to get an idea, the release mentions anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. These are a type of drugs that inhibit the activity of certain proteins (they inhibit PD1 and CTLA4, which are types of proteins. By stopping their activity, they help in stopping the growth of cancer tumors). There are several drugs that fall under these categories and treat a wide variety of cancers. Sofusa can potentially play a vital role in all these treatments. This is like several companies developing apps while Sorrento is developing a new smartphone technology. Each app has its rightful use and market. But once the new smartphone is up and working, all apps will need it. So this technology has huge revenue implications. The fact we are hearing good news about it is HUGE. As for the results themselves: The DAS28 test measures rheumatoid activity in 28 joints in the patient's body. The joints might be swollen or tender (hurting). This patient had a DAS28 score of 4.6, with 18 out of 28 joints compromised. That is considered moderate to high disease activity. There are 4 levels of DAS 28 scores going from remission (the best) to high (the worst). So this patient was not in the worst shape going in, but pretty bad. Using Sofusa to deliver the Enbrel drug, in just 4 weeks (this is a very short time for this type of disease!!) the results went from 4.6 to 3.0. The total amount of compromised joints, from 18 to 11. That is a dramatic change. The patient went from being somewhere between level 3 and 4, to being in the lower level 2, called ""low disease activity"", which indicates it's moving towards remission (the lowest level). For someone suffering from this condition, it's a real life changer. For the company selling Enbrel, it's a real market changer. And if it can equally help people with tumors, Sofusa becomes a major therapeutic factor. I hope investors understand this. It's another major development in an already extremely promising pipeline which is currently badly undervalued. If the price doesn't spike today by 10-15%, as it should, just from this news, it would be disappointing. But if you are long, today's price change isn't what matters the most. It’s the understanding that Sorrento / SRNE has ANOTHER ace in its hand!"

Increased by 399%. $NRG PS The list also contained companies Codiak BioSciences and Dynavax Technologies, but the bot did not pass them through due to weak capitalization.

I have followed Ms. Wood since she appeared on We Study Billionaires. From the minute I heard the interview I realized that this person had no clue what she was talking about. To the credit of the Podcast hosts they mentioned that ARKK would have issues with outflows leading to lower stock prices in a later Podcast, which they have. I should have shorted it, but I'm not rich. Here are some of her stances: ​ She predicts CoinBit $500,000. She is all-in on Tesla. She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time. She has decreased her position in Netflix. ​ I think that the increase size of her fund will continue to limit her ability to invest in anything interesting. The longshots in her portfolio which have had massive success are often successful because her fund's investment has massively increased their market cap. She has also tied herself so tightly to Tesla that she can never hop off that ride. She's tied to the autopilot whether it goes to the moon or into a tree. I'm not denying that she has had good results during this bull market, but I think a fund that goes the other direction will do very well over the next 5 years. ​ Edit - I forgot that she is long COIN."

And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action. The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it’s a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle’s tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal. With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle’s opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price. Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone. Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary. MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up. TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though. I hope, you’re happy now, u/memetron9000! Edit. It seems that you can’t really read, so here’s a pic UWMC"

Buy the dips.DD (self.wallstreetbets),Death_and_taxes2,30,36,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nghmhm/nue_is_strong_as_steel_buy_the_dips/,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio. With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year. Nucor’s advantage Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world. Record breaking year Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said. This was the most profitable quarter in the company’s history, and next quarter will be even better. Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. $3 Billion share buyback After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding. This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucors-nue-board-approves-upto-144402940.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACWBuv6e3QIgwJwbEyZcMzIm66vAqeGiL87eT9covILaILC4gFtHpmnTaiEHNE9OPGnnneWieYG1U74csNNaKjKXw4cBpfsBJ_ieRDdSq0qf12RjsZSebw_XIQZFZVEmDoE6zpM6XPkdt3ntlkWaDhbrNxIpzGe4hzzV8kcUowPy In addition to the buyback, the company has raised its dividend every year. With the recent run up in the stock price, the annual dividend of $1.62 only provides a 1.6% return. However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021). The future is bright Recently, Nucor and Array Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers of ground-mounting systems used in solar energy projects, announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies. Under the new agreement, NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel, which are needed for Array's production of several parts and components used in its solar systems. It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry. Last year, the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15% just through September 2020. Other considerations As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which not only includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, which will help all steel producers, but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects, which could also go to help NUE’s growth. It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated. Conclusion NUE is a great company and a great long-term play. It’s stock has had a good run over the past few months, and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter. For investors with more of a risk appetite, companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns."
22,2021-05-19,20:51:00,Apple Inc Technical Analysis D.DTechnical Analysis (self.wallstreetbets),SupplyAndDemandGuy,29,48,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nggpql/apple_inc_technical_analysis_dd/,"I thought I'd share a price action based technical analysis side due diligence. I believe a lot of investors don't necessarily look at this point of view because ""time in the markets, beats timing the market"" but hear me out. I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn't really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I'm as ""shrewd"" of an enterprising investor as the man suggests, I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made. If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is $1000. I can take it at market value, or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good ~10%/20% discount. That's approx $200 saved just by talking. A save that you can get a good shirt, knickers and socks to go with your new suit. This is how I see price action technical analysis. Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business. Apple Inc Ticker $AAPL - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. The distribution schematic chart and annotations for visual. At PSY which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""bought the dip"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (BCLX). At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price. With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (AR). This is obviously because there aren't any strong hands fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time. But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (ST). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to support. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher This is why after the up thrust (UT), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (UTAD). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand. An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear"" as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting. Why I believe we're reaccumulating now? Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, inducing fear and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines). This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low. This level is where my limit orders are placed. Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on price behavioral systems developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+) based on the law of cause and effect. The range may be coming to an end. TL;DR 2. 🦍 Stands on elevated ground and pees on an anthill. Eats two green (unripe) bananas and beats his chest a few times. Jumps on an AAPL apple tree and 🚀🚀 emojis! From $100"

Inflation hasn't changed in the last month, but perception has. Yes, CPI has gone up, but it's just due to supply side shocks. However, this is a game of 'Lodden Thinks'. Where does everyone else think that they should put their money during times of high inflation and uncertainty in the stock market? Commodities. Fortunately for gold, most commodities have already skyrocketed and are currently in backwardation. GLD and gold mining companies are becoming the new hot shit. The biggest enemies of gold are 10 year treasuries and Michael Saylor (half joking about that). There's a lot of speculation that 10 year yields are on the verge of skyrocketing. The 10 year will go up for 2 reasons: 1) Powell turns off the printer. He's said before that the current perceived inflation is due to supply side shocks and will decrease. I expect him to continue his doveishness at the next FOMC meeting in june. 2) People find a better risk free asset (or the risk/reward ratio becomes crappier on the 10 year). This, i'm not so sure about. But the whole world economy has gone to shit, so I don't think there's much of a choice. TLDR; Buy GLD and GOLD. Positions: June 21 GLD 174c. And i'll be rollin.

We can see the almost perfect inversion between low variance probabilities and medium. https://preview.redd.it/eqnl6ctzl1071.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f75444f4a5a854e7d842bb7f212c378c442f928 Most of those high variance returns come from changes from low to high variance. https://preview.redd.it/awjv82x4m1071.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=840a93a87d1745f84d79964cc296b8b282ff4153 This shows that high variance returns are more like surprises in the market because they come from low variance returns, its not a gradual buildup.

Confirming results and possibly making indicators could be comparing covariances and trends between the time series and then if a there is a shift that is probably a break in the relationship which probably leads to a time of high variance · QQQ did exhibit high variance regime for a longer sustained time and that may be because of its growth-orientation.

Hopefully y'all ain't gentle because this time we going HARD! I will be talking about Switch. A company that provides data centers to some of the world's most secure clientele. What is Switch? Switch, Inc. (Nevada) engages in the provision of technology infrastructure. It specializes in the development of digital platforms for digital media companies, cloud and managed service providers, financial institutions, and telecommunications providers. The firm's products include Switch CONNECT and Switch SAFE. The company was founded by Rob Roy in 2000 and is headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The listed name for SWCH is Switch, Inc. Class A Common Stock. Down below I will keep it simple. Listing Pros and Cons to this company. Pros: Provides data centers to all four major latency zones in America. The Core Campus (Southwestern United States), The Citadel Campus (Northwestern United States), The Pyramid Campus (Northeastern United States), The Keep Campus (Southeastern United States). source Recent acquisition of Data Foundry allows the company to have exposure to Texas based clients and real estate. Security on campus is top notch. Both inside the Data centers and outside. Haven't personally worked with their systems, but they have top notch security systems in place inside their software. (with recent hacks to global infrastructure imo VERY IMPORTANT). Outside they have multiple gates and security keeping close guard of campuses. It is like a well kept fortress of data, a place where you can trust and depend upon for safety. source Switch operates by buying data center real estate and being very similar to a REIT. However, since their structuring is different than a REIT they are not required to pay dividends on most of their profits. This allows them to have cash on hand to fund future growth. source Switch is also a huge player for renewable energy. They make a huge point to reduce their carbon impact. They do this with geothermal energy and also Solar. All their campuses have renewables in place. I believe this is important in the sense of being a responsible investor, but renewables also have a great deal of benefits on the cost side of things too.

30,2021-05-19,00:21:28,Discovering the True Rate of Inflation: A DD on the FedOCDD (self.wallstreetbets),DigitalSheikh,253,195,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfqs26/discovering_the_true_rate_of_inflation_a_dd_on/,"Would have posted on r/investing, but they don't allow graphs. Read at your own risk. So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB: The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that. Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully. So... What is the actual Inflation Rate? Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart). 10 years of price increases across my basket of prices. What does this overall picture say about our two theses? To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates. To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary. What about inflation in Housing? Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure. A graph of inflation in housing prices, 2011-2021 That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic. A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021 I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. How did you come up with these numbers? I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from here. This is what the average household's spending habits look like. To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes, food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above. I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment producer price indexto to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. Last thing I'll note: If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have decreased about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages exploded. However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win. https://preview.redd.it/8vzzrknsyyz61.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a1ba2ddc10e53d0553e597ae6d990751a23cc14 Alright, I'm done now. Go buy OTM PLTR calls or something.

It's been in the making for just about 10 years now. $GC 1 Year 1 Day First - let's take a look at the 1 year 1 day chart. Here - we are breaking what appears to just be a broadening descending wedge (a massive one). The breakout point was 1853 - and it needs to hold 1848 to stay intact. You can see we already got some follow through here. Now, price targets/resistances are 1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3. Keep in mind - the larger the pattern, the larger the move, the longer it takes to play out. This isn't going to happen overnight. Timeframe to complete the move is 3-6 months - and we could form lots of smaller patterns in between. Every time we cross one of those resistances, it should become a support. Also note that upon reaching them, it's likely we consolidate for a few days. Overall - a super clean setup, and a play I've been eyeing since March. Lastly, keep in mind - for a setup of this magnitude, you want the weekly close for confirmation. But - what makes this really interesting is the 10 year 1 week chart. $GC 10 Year 1 Week Here, we have an absolutely massive cup and handle dating back to 2011. In this context - the addition of this data mainly means we can look for a much higher price target on the wedge breakout. As a result - I'm targeting $GC 2250 - 2500 within the next year. Remember what I said about timeframes. This could take quite a while. For this setup to trigger - I'm looking for the monthly close above that first breakout point. And... that's it. Remember, technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. Fake outs can and do happen. That's why we identify key levels to tell where we are within a setup. Take it step by step. TL;DR - $GC above 1853 weekly close targets 1918.8, 1963.7, 1987.5, 2027.4, 2049.3 $GC above 1853 monthly close targets 2250, 2500 Positions - $GLD 180c for July @ 1.94 - I plan to roll them back as time passes.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a fantastic setup. AMC TA Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ 11.58. 13.24 is key support now, keep an eye on that. We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN). Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up. Price targets are 17.25 & 20.36. This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple. TL;DR - AMC actually looks good for once from an unbiased technical standpoint Not Financial Advice Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout."

Usually a company like GM should be trading at a multiple, instead they are trading for half the market cap of total earnings. Not saying this is the only factor but is definitely there. The EV vehicle transitions followed by announcements, release dates, increased earnings, new jobs all could be leading factors why GM stock reaches $90. My plays are as follow: BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2022 x 10 contracts BUY GM OPTION $90 TARGET EXPIRATION JAN 2023 x 10 contracts GM has the infastructure to support a massive takeover of EV, Tesla can barely deliver cars to people that ordered them 6 months ago. The market cap difference is $650 Billion. When GM siphons some of that market cap you can see GM stock trading anywhere from $150 to $300 making traders profits of anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million in profits. Check Options profit calculator for that option play and look at profit targets of $90 to $300. It will show what each option will be worth at each price level ​ SEE YOU GUYS AT THE BANK!"

Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I’m sure there’s someone else who also remembers and can corroborate – and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can’t imagine this post won’t make the cut, so here goes: In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show – think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show). It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing. I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read. To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks. Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way. By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most “amazing” woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips. THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING. After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market. She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don’t know – why would I know?”, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"". This was not her being nervous – it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight. The word malicious doesn’t even begin to describe her appearance that night. Despite Jim’s continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him. Eventually, you could cut the tension with a knife – and this was over the radio. Anyway, as my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle – I don’t think that I was ever more embarrassed for another human being as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night. Again, I admire Jim’s enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail. And I don’t blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show."

GME TA The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but... TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD! Confluence between technicals generate the best signals. This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11. And... that's it. I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up. TL;DR - GME actually looks good for once from an unbiased technical standpoint EDIT: Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point. Edit 2: Not Financial Advice (i thought that was a given) Edit 3: It's back testing so far - really common in Technical Analysis. Price will retrace the pattern it broke from before deciding direction. Focused on the daily close to determine whether it's a fake breakout (when a stock closes back inside a pattern the candle after breaking out) - which happens. Edit 4: Backtested - and bouncing so far. Really important to reclaim 174.26 on the hourly close. You can see we bounced off this zone from 168.07 - 167.55 - that's key demand or support. https://ibb.co/XS1t1dL Edit 5: Reclaimed 174.26 - back tested that as well. Key levels are normally retraced as we move. Price wants to confirm that resistance has become a support. Now, 174.26 must hold as support - and we are looking pretty good. https://ibb.co/fCrq0Fb Edit 6: Bull flagging now into lunch time, New support put up at 176.48. Constructive. https://ibb.co/3WTR25r Edit 7: Great breakout from that flag. New support put up at 181.50. Still need the 1:45 close for confirmation. Look at the volume on that candle - shorts trying to defend this breakout with their lives. https://ibb.co/cFHv6W6 Edit 8: Keyboard warriors storming my DMs at open - quit trading, you are more driven by your emotions than a teenage girl. Self proclaimed geniuses saying ""TA Doesn't Work On GME, Ban"" - it's not that TA doesn't work on GME: The issue is - all the TA you guys normally upvote is done by some kid who watched three YouTube videos on it the night before. I don't blame you for feeling that way though - so many of these people the past few months with the influx of retail in trading. Just because you don't understand something and are afraid to admit it, doesn't mean you should dismiss it. The sheer amount of hate GME posts get on this sub is a super bullish data point honestly - insane how sentiment shifted. You guys are getting played like a fiddle. The tutes have been pushing this thing both ways the whole time and using you all as a scapegoat. Lastly I, appreciate the people who have been messaging me with legitimate questions eager to learn. DMs are open. Edit 9: 189.00 is the next resistance coming up - careful there. Like I said, 181.50 is the new support to hold. Still on track for my price targets. Volume is in all the right spots. Edit 10: Backtested & we are moving again. Support is actually a zone from 182.51 - 181.50. Notice how the volume on that red candle was literally nothing compared to the prior two. Remember some resistance at 189.00 - might flag there the rest of the day. https://ibb.co/hyj7mrf Edit 11 [3:13 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Notice how every candle we aren't making new highs has decreased volume. Still bullish consolidation below this key 189.00 resistance. Above there, straight to 200+. Shorts going to fight for their lives this last hour. I'm watching this rising channel in yellow to dictate the near-term trend. https://ibb.co/R634KNj Edit 12 [3:46 P.M. 5/18/2021]: They got the close just below the uptrend. Not a great sign - but only a 15m trend so not too damning. We need to hold 182.51 - 181.50. They are going to try and test that now. Shorts doing everything they can to dump this thing before we close to high up. Still garbage volume on the red candles which is encouraging. Literally no volume the last hour as we trend down. https://ibb.co/VpDJQr0 Edit 12 [4:01 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Not an awful close - but definitely not a great one. Shorts fought hard end of day - the fuckers. They know if we break 189 they are done for. Important thing though - breakout is still intact. Also - broader market dumped hard end of day which didn't help. Tomorrow - will be looking for 173.02 and 167.57 to hold - and looking for 182.54 to break (as well as 189.00). https://ibb.co/5YcfNmG Hope regardless of the end result you guys can pull some knowledge from this. Appreciate all the awards. Keep in mind this is a swing trade so could take a couple weeks to play out. Will probably move quicker since it’s GME. Edit 13 [9:35 A.M. 5/19/2021]: Again getting dragged by the broader market. Major indexes opened -2%. Still - holding up relatively well honestly. Basically - between 182.54 - 167.57 is CHOP. It's when we break one of those that we can see the next move play out. Remember I said this is a swing - on these kinds of trades I just focus on the daily chart (and sometimes the hourly for monitoring the health of the trends). Major point is - - Above 167.57 (and that teal line) the breakout is still intact https://ibb.co/r7qdLmW Edit 14 [4:00 P.M. 5/19/2021]: What a close. Actually really interesting price action today. We were able to defend all those levels. Not only that, but we fully backtested the pattern to the tick. Breakout is fully intact still - so long as we are above this teal line. Just sitting in limbo waiting for volume to come in. Technicals often precede news so we could see a catalyst soon. 1h chart: https://ibb.co/v45MPzP 1D chart: https://ibb.co/y4YqMtJ Notice the volume was garbage today too. So far a textbook backtest. Levels for tomorrow: 168.00, 163.00 support 172.60, 183.11, 189.00 resistance"

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day. This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!). I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM. The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume. Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP. Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity. Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering. UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT. UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows."

We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues. $BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near). Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade... Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event."

I would like you all to understand, however, that buying call options on the Teucrium Corn fund that tracks a mix of Corn futures could lead to a profitable trade. It is an accessible and liquid way to trade the price of corn. Corn the US crop that has had its highs and lows over a long history but continues to have massive demand worldwide for a variety of uses and it is not slowing. Instead, weather risks, drought risks, execution risks, and other supply chain bottlenecks have impacts on the prices in the short and mid term and sometimes the long term. BEFORE you make any investment decision in Corn, let’s run through these important things: 1. WHO grows corn? The 2 leading producers of corn include the US at 1 and China at 2 that is over 50% of total production. 2. WHO consumes Corn? Well… it’s The US and China accounting for over 50% of total consumption 3.WHO is the top exporter? The US is the top exporter 4.WHO is top importer? China is the top importer by far (Mexico was for years until this year and commitments for next year) 5. Risks? As with every investment there is always downside risk! The downside risk here could be from many different factors, however, these are less likely and at current corn prices already priced in. These include: -Cancellations from china for old crop - Wheat prices or soybean prices falling dramatically since certain uses such as feed for animals is cost competitive with wheat and also for ethanol production and corn oil vs soybean oil. -The absence of supply chain disruptions which, let’s face it, is not the theme so far in 2021.

It means that so many people filed lawsuits, including class actions, that they had to be consolidated into a single court as to avoid duplicitous litigation; very normal these days, but also indicative that this is a big deal legally speaking. Receiving an MDL assignment is considered very prestigious for a federal judge because it takes so much personal involvement and the cases often affect many, many people plus the state of the law more generally. If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions.

Let me dig in ! The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. NFIB Shows Confidence Drop The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8. Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels. 📷 https://preview.redd.it/bs5wfwf09vz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fa466c127933694132c00e2b903ff01c5f2102 Employment To Remain Weak If small businesses think the economy is “actually” improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual “demand” meets its operating cash flows. Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy. ​ https://preview.redd.it/ew6w5tu19vz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba4677ec15d513e78d6d19644722b133068a48 Businesses understand that the stimulus “pulled forward” much of the current demand. As such, they can not commit to the “costs” of “long-term employment” for a “short-term” artificial economic boost. The Big Hit Is Coming Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation. Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality. ​ https://preview.redd.it/0bcfon349vz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b498f76db582407f08e593e10dc5692e6005f2 There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets. At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%, ​ https://preview.redd.it/w1cuikh69vz61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b01f66a5badd3fc80e79abecd97096e309324a5 Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it’ll be worse than expected: We finally got “official” confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off: The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled. ​ https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It’s not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don’t hold your breath, ​ https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time—i.e., the CPI is likely going even higher. If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a “return to work bonus” in order to get people to go back to work. ""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Pinterest is the next YouTube, where it was mostly built by women who are posting educational and idea based content on the platform. They just released a Live feature, where you can sign up for a live broadcast and it is absolutely beautiful. pinterest is where women go to look for ideas and plan, so they don't need to be influenced. THEY ARE ALREADY INCENTIVIZED TO ENGAGE. pinterest is clearly the next YouTube and they are absolutely killing it in international growth. They don't grow in the US as much because they already have the majority of US women on the platform. Pinterest will grow beyond 1 billion monthly users sooner than later. Don't believe me? Ask 10 women in your life."

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts. Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it’s just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain [nut]"" The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way. Twitter screenshot I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days. The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange."

His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that’s why I’m not Dr. Burry. I’m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead. The reason I’m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I’m missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn’t detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I’m thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don’t think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January. If there’s anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I’m interested in hearing other opinions on this. POSITIONS: I have no contracts at the moment, will update if I enter into anything."

62,2021-05-17,21:46:48,UWMC: The Thesis on Why I'm Still In Even Though I finally Turned a Profit or Never Tell Me The Odds. It's Tendies or Guh on my options people.Discussion (self.wallstreetbets),Hani95,534,104,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nesw0u/uwmc_the_thesis_on_why_im_still_in_even_though_i/,"Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares! Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around.... Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge. So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you. I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao. And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah. I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener. Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC. This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

65,2021-05-17,12:23:47,$200K all-in because I believe that $UWMC is undervalued. CEO agreed undervalued and declared a buyback to retire class A float (only class that gets dividends). BULLISH trend this week!Discussion (self.wallstreetbets),workinguntil65oridie,1557,510,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/neetnp/200k_allin_because_i_believe_that_uwmc_is/,"I have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1 earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while competitors are lagged. During the Q4 2020 earnings call he had mused about options that would be on the stable, special dividend, buyback or raising the dividend. Feb Q4 Earnings Quote: The Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be paid on April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. We expect this to be a regular quarterly dividend. And so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet is a fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and we have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think about this going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're going to maybe be more profitable than some expected and be very successful in 2021. And if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much, we will be delivering that back. And whether we have to change the dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend, those things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares. May Q1 Earnings Quote: As you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special dividend or a share buyback program. As you guys have seen, we concluded share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward shareholders. We announced the authorization of $300 million share buyback over the next 24 months. And quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that. Then in answering a question from an analyst Doug Harter - Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you mentioned sort of the float. I guess just how are you thinking about kind of how much of the float you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share repurchase? Mat Ishbia - Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go because at this stock price, I'm a buyer, right? And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I think, as our legal teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know how many I can buy and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the float. If the float was not a concern, we'd be more aggressive. However, we have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm going to take advantage of that opportunity while being conscientious of our partners in the float. TL/DR: UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that it will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage. The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are not waiting, it's being deployed now. Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC ​ This is a CAD portfolio look at the USD info at the bottom"

69,2021-05-17,13:20:55,$UWMC - The Long ViewOCDD (self.wallstreetbets),Accurate_Sandwich_49,705,286,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/neg3ey/uwmc_the_long_view/,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It’s the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. It’s CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it’s 12th employee and who’s dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, ~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. What trends are pushing $UWMC’s stock down? The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates: About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. The strength of the broker channel: UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn’t have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. Short Interest: Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi’s are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. SPAC: It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money. Competitors: Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up? Short term retail pressure: there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM’s long term perspective, so I’ll let this post take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. Broker Channel Growth: Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ⅓ mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn’t crazy to think they could get back to ⅓ as it is growing: https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket’s retail channel has 4% margins and it’s partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. New Product Offerings: UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM’s, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation: Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. UWM “All In” Ultimatum: Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don’t work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway’s partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. Aggressive Capital returns: UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them ~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. Long Term Prediction: I’m invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and *potentially* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years. ​ Price Target: $14/share in 2023"

The two stocks that they projected would gain the most are listed below. - FuelCell Energy (FCEL) - iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) These two are predicted to skyrocket under the Biden administration due to his push for renewable energy, especially if the Green New Deal is passed. Though they seem like big bets, I am confident in my advisors and I know that this community has never been afraid of big bets and will trust in my advisors as well."

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument. Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us. All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole` company doing good things (making money). We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;) 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 UWMC 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀Short Squeeze.Short borrow costs skyrocketed from 30% to over 93% in a few hours on Friday: They cannot keep shorting at this price. It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same. It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!! https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 UWMC 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀Gamma squeeze:https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/uwmc/options Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts. Stock BuyBack, Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th. Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool. Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic. Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 UWMC 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 **🚀UWMC is a good company, not just a memestock:**UWMC is a good company that pays a good dividend, has a good CEO, and is the king of B2B mortgage refinance. I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock. I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral. Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well. Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM. MIX IT UP! This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra, TL;DR: 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 UWMC 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 TO THA MOON!

73,2021-05-18,14:07:41,iQIYI Inc investment thesis and summary of DDDD (self.wallstreetbets),STONKS_for_IQ,3,25,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfbmkd/iqiyi_inc_investment_thesis_and_summary_of_dd/,"Disclaimer and Risks: This is not a financial advice. Be cautious to bet against Winnie the Pooh🐻. One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU’s revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I’m very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately. ​ Hi everyone, I’m here with another DD, but this time it’ll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I’ve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you ​ What is IQ? iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share. ​ How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report? Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000. Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content. Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery. Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter. Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines. Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost. Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year. Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020. Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020. Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss. Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020. Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion). ​ Financial Guidance For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change. Price Target If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas"

76,2021-05-17,17:12:26,"Crayon Make Pattern, Pattern Make Money - How to Draw and Trade with Channel Line Patterns and Technical AnalysisOCTechnical Analysis (self.wallstreetbets)",Plant-Objective,56,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nelwxu/crayon_make_pattern_pattern_make_money_how_to/,"What if you knew where prices would go and when they would get there? It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns. ​ Prices respect the channel lines Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade. They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it. ​ Channel line pattern with bounces circled How do you define a channel pattern? A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are trading within a channel. ​ A trendline drawn off of the highs Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power. ​ Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities. How to Draw Channel Lines So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, how can you draw a channel line on a price chart? The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades. To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line. ​ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes. Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement. It takes a lot of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate future price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts. Types of Channel Lines The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range. ​ Uptrend A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play. ​ Downtrend with channel break In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy. In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line. ​ Range The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing. ​ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity. The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal. How to Trade With Channel Lines Because channel line patterns offer areas that have a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement. ​ A channel bounce trade with >2:1 risk:reward The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the high risk to reward offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio. Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels: ​ Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there. ​ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points Thanks for reading.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows. The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs. There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021 Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue. I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks. This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can. If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand. What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices. Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is. My positions: ~$21k Western Digital, ~$6k Seagate"

If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop. ​ https://preview.redd.it/1w7ibai2joz61.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=83f35051fc0b07980181b14bdad493dfc7aa4958 Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA. ​ https://preview.redd.it/wqisl7e4joz61.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd01cd8896624817e553901bac203aec1b206adc Now obviously Im looking at this week so let's look at the last week. ​ https://preview.redd.it/dsxic976joz61.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b56a04e6f87675215343efe9d8c0d62f9c3b08a If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond. Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances. ​ https://preview.redd.it/mwrgruv7joz61.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=5447888d78080f901b24bb5b18b73bfcebb5106c I have a feeling we break that $7.14 range highlighted on the 30minute as our next resistance then it's on to $8 $9 and $10!"

82,2021-05-17,17:38:52,Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative?Discussion (self.wallstreetbets),GushingGranny1,16,18,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nemlpe/are_commodity_futures_going_against_the/,"So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example). My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down CME Link? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future. Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year Copper Link. On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well Corn Futures. So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here? Tl;Dr: Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?"

84,2021-05-18,05:13:17,Why is RKT dead to WSB?Discussion (self.wallstreetbets),Spleaster,4,102,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nf1xrj/why_is_rkt_dead_to_wsb/,Ok so I was long RKT since IPO. I recently doubled down and bought 100 option contacts for $0.64 at the most recent dip after earnings. I have 300 shares and 100 contracts call for Jan 2022 strike $33. Is UWMC that much better that I should ditch RKT? If so please explain. I know RKT guidance is down but the P/E ratio of under 7 is extremely cheap They have a great current ratio They are profitable which is great during inflation times like now. Revenue and earnings are steady in guidance for the next two years Possible addition to S&P 500 Dominant name in the industry This is a conversation around fundamentals. If UWMC is a pure short squeeze I understand but I think RKT is so much better than it’s valued or forecasted to perform relative to other stocks in the broader market. Also I’m not a hater I think both stocks (RKT and UWMC) can do great over the next 5 years.
85,2021-05-16,16:33:19,I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!OCDiscussion (self.wallstreetbets),nobjos,768,124,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/,"This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes! Most Discussed Stocks of the Week https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the ~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment. Top Growing Stocks of the Week Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list. Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO) was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment. Trade Desk($TTD) stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company’s latest earnings report. Even though the company’s revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to “Cookie Crisis” - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data – through third-party “cookies” – is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk’s business model. Fubotv ($FUBO) stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%. Alibaba Group ($BABA) has been down ~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company’s earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it’s not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks. UWM holdings ($UWMC) has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO’s announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company’s share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst. SOME FAQ’s: How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative). What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made. All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether. The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week, I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week. Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below! Spreadsheet HERE Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit. Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention! Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking massive for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside. Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week. If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa. Don't fall for the Solar trap. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers. Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with. Conclusion We’ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there’s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the spreadsheet to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! Happy Trading Everybody! :)"

The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month. This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months. Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of 5G network installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now."
89,2021-05-17,03:06:46,HD earnings Strangle with JACKPOT!Discussion (self.wallstreetbets),risk-vs-reward,42,39,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ne552p/hd_earnings_strangle_with_jackpot/,"First off, this is my first Discussion on r/Wallstreetbets. Not financial advice. I'm probably retarded. That's being said let's go! Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least. November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print. Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right? Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle. If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"". Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino. Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape. TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies. Edit: the d d post was likely deleted because no charts or links is my best guess. Sorry! I hope the mods will allow this one. If this gets deleted it is likely because I haven’t posted here in a while in which case I don’t know how to contribute going forward... Update: well this one aged like milk. The volatility was never there. The good news for me is that at the encouragement of others I reversed myself and went with the 5/28 300/305/335/340 IC for a $1.35cr."
90,2021-05-16,14:29:43,"This is not economic boom, this is just recovery !!!!DD (self.wallstreetbets)",Kimaxw,395,287,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndpiru/this_is_not_economic_boom_this_is_just_recovery/,"The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn’t. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States. Small businesses (defined as fewer than 500 employees) account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment. The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. ​ https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b Let’s dig in. NFIB Shows Confidence Drop The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8. Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels. ​ https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery, “confidence” remains extremely weak. The importance of “weak confidence” also affects the “risk” business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. Importantly, this is a “sentiment” based survey. Such is a crucial concept to understand as “planning” to do something and “doing” it can be very different. An Economic Boom Will Require Participation Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive “pent-up” demand as the economy reopens. I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits. Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or “pent-up” consumption into the present. However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same. Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don’t have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability. If businesses were expecting a massive surge in “pent up” demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it. Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows. Employment To Remain Weak If small businesses think the economy is “actually” improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual “demand” meets its operating cash flows. To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things: Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to; The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand. Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy. ​ https://preview.redd.it/qgpd1rqeshz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf5af23ed3d590678c02894f1f43198031bf874 Businesses understand that the stimulus “pulled forward” much of the current demand. As such, they can not commit to the “costs” of “long-term employment” for a “short-term” artificial economic boost. The Big Hit Is Coming Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation. Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality. ​ https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17 While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term. Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than “booming.” A Recovery Versus An Expansion With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity. Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since deficit-based spending is deflationary, the outcome will fall well short of expectations. “in 1998, the Federal Reserve “crossed the ‘Rubicon,’ whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‘debt burden’ detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.” https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381 Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence. The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in “confidence” is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. ​ https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e Conclusion Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee. While there are indeed “inflationary pressures” short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term. There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Most importantly, there is a massive difference between “getting back to even” versus “growing the economy.” One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not. Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one’s wealth longer-term. Thanks for addendum : Lance Roberts"

92,2021-05-16,16:51:38,Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports.Discussion (self.wallstreetbets),notbrokemexican,129,110,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndsgrw/roblox_will_be_volatile_in_2021_due_to_monthly/,"Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share. I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting. I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults. Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean. Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time. And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include: Eating and staying alive Clothes Toys Education Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential."
93,2021-05-17,06:09:30,"Discussion: Reopening Trade (Air/Cruise, Casinos, Oil)Discussion (self.wallstreetbets)",BAGross85,9,52,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ne8d41/discussion_reopening_trade_aircruise_casinos_oil/,"I’m seeing macro trendlines of around 6 months (beginning November 6th, connecting around February 5th, and testing resistance right around now) in most of these stocks. Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I’ll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits! MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I’m swinging for the MIL on this! I’m a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked). The CDC letting “vaccinated” people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend... Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks. The market rewards those who risk more!............but only when you are correct in your prediction. Let’s hear the case from the Bears."
94,2021-05-16,00:39:04,"UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)DD (self.wallstreetbets)",dadozer,955,347,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/,"I'm sure you've all seen some of this in various threads over the last few days so here is what I see as the complete short term case for UWMC in one place. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor this is not advice don't listen to me etc. Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the fundamentals of this company today (they're great), the value even with no short-term price movement, a super good dividend, the wild housing market, the great strategic decisions the company has made, or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock. ​ Low float, low volume UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with ~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million. Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly. ​ Short interest, high short volume In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. (Source) The shorts are here and they are relentless. ​ Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short. (Source) It's over 300% on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs. Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll let the recent post on this speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available. ​ Huge Buyback Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back $300 million in stock over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or half of the active float of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though. What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock. It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and public statements from the CEO, It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical. ​ Options - Would you look at that This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly, the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 - meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares. The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring. ​ Conclusion - What needs to happen First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.) Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week. TL;DR: This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback. The conditions are perfect for a huge run."
95,2021-05-17,16:06:02,MYOV - Back To Back CatalystsDiscussion (self.wallstreetbets),awoketaco,0,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nek6rk/myov_back_to_back_catalysts/,"Hi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I’m not a financial advisor. The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well. They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer. Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer. Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, if FDA decides early, both could happen this week. Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company’s end. Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo. If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions. Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment Quick list of upcoming catalysts: THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer) By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA Catalysts that could happen at any time: BUYOUT from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant). Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline. TLDR: EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon. Positions: 22.5k shares, 275 calls (mostly leaps)."
