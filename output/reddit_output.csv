What is it with loser ex-mods hijacking the WSB name and using crypto to scam people? People keep posting a press release about an ""official"" WallStreetBets distributed app. (Aka, a crypto pyramid scheme) Nothing could be further from the truth. We are strongly anti-monetization. This scam has nothing to do with us. This is yet another attempt for the pathetic and disgraced founder (removed by Reddit Admins in 2020) to cash out on a subreddit whose only contributions allegedly include: Phishing our users Attempting to run a shitty paid mentoring group Selling advertising on the subreddit Trying to turn options trading into an esport Selling WSB out to movie producers Attempting to change our logo to some god awful abomination Don't throw away your money on this scam. Throw it away on OTM FDs instead. Anything outside of: r/wallstreetbets discord.gg/wallstreetbets twitter.com/Official_WSB has nothing to do with us. If you're giving them your money, you're probably being scammed."

4,2021-05-05,02:21:32,Why you should hold RKT after tomorrow’s close. (Let the name calling begin)Discussion (self.wallstreetbets),BigDaddyJ_Stocks,124,73,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n54xuv/why_you_should_hold_rkt_after_tomorrows_close_let/,"I have seen lots of RKT posts and comments, and have made quite a few myself. While I do believe it goes way up tomorrow, ($35-$40ish), I think Thursday is really the day to watch. Rocket is launching Rocket Auto soon and for some reason it’s rarely mentioned in these Rocket posts except for the ones with thorough DD. Please realize this isn’t just funding car loans, they will actually be SELLING CARS online as well. It’s similar to Carvana. The potential for their revenue to increase 50-100% in the next year exists with that. And, there is no reason to doubt they will take over market share there just as they have with mortgages. Now, back to why you should hold after close tomorrow... I fully expect them to announce the launch date for the Rocket Auto division along with some details and guidance around it tomorrow afternoon. Obviously the stock is already severely undervalued, but factor in the coming soon Rocket Auto and we should really be $60-$70. RKT is at the bottom now and has traded around $22 for 2 months straight. Is there really downside risk to holding? I don’t think so. TBH if you hang on to it a few more months you could probably triple your money. The days are boring flatlining are coming to and end quickly. Now go ahead and tell me how stupid I am for wanting to hold through ER. I can take it."

It is now up 50%+ the past two weeks. Last but not least... The G.O.A.T Mr. Zack Morris is all over Ashford Hospitality Group with his price target $10+. https://twitter.com/MrZackMorris The GOAT simply doesn't miss. He alerted: $AMC $2 > $25 $NAKD $.044 > $2.5 $SNDL $0.6 > $4 and many more... ​ TLDR: This was a $20 stock pre-covid. Ashford Hospitality Group owns tons of Marriots, Embassy Suites, etc around the U.S and this industry is at its lows. With most Americans now vaccinated and being able to travel for the first time in 1.5 years, it will easily hit $10+ and bless us apes with 300% gains. ​ ​ ​ ​ https://preview.redd.it/b13gag7az7x61.png?width=469&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea78e2b289dffaf2d29c3065bcc02d13453cb6a ​ https://preview.redd.it/wt08hc2dz7x61.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=013b294cd14a44efa584baf83aab55cbd9d898bb ​ not financial advice"
